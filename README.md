DOMShell
========

A temerarious attempt to shove support for modern JavaScript down IE6-7's feeble throats.

Not content to tip-toe around the retarded shortcomings of legacy browsers, I instead took it upon myself to shirtfront the hell out of IE6/7, unleashing upon the past a spastic assault of tangled JS hacks, DOM polyfills, and other crap we all would've been too scared to use 5-6 years ago.
